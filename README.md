Exp.No:2(a)	ITERATIVE STATEMENTS- PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS
### AIM
To create a python program for printing n natural numbers.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Use input() to read the value of n (the upper limit) from the user.

Step 3:	 Convert the input to an integer.

Step 4:	 Display the message "Natural Numbers are :".

Step 5:	 Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).

Step 6:	 In each iteration, print the current value of i.

Step 7:	 Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
n=int(input())
print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    print(i)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program for printing n natural numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.

Exp.No:2(b)	FUNCTIONS-PERFECT NUMBER

### AIM
To write a Python Program to check if a number is a Perfect number using the concept of functions.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Read the number n from the user using input().

Step 3:	 Convert the input to an integer.

Step 4:	 Define the Function perfectNumber(n) with below steps.

Step 5:	 Initialize a variable factor_sum to 0

Step 6:	Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n//2 (as divisors of a number can't be greater than half of it).

Step 7:	If a number i divides n perfectly (i.e., n % i == 0), add i to factor_sum.

Step 8:	If factor_sum is equal to n, then print the number is a perfect number.Otherwise, print it's not a perfect number.

Step 9:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```def perfectnumber(n):
    factor_sum=0
    for i in range(1,n//2+1):
        if(n%i==0):
            factor_sum+=i
    if(n==factor_sum):
        print("The number is a Perfect number!")	
    else:
        print("The number is not a Perfect number!")
num=int(input())
perfectnumber(num)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program to check if a number is a perfect number or not has been implemented and executed successfully.

Exp.No:2(c)	BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS- RELATING TWO NUMBERS

### AIM
To write a python program to check the relation between them. That is if one number is greater or equal or lesser than another number using the lambda function.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Use eval() to get the two numbers (num1 and num2) from the user.

Step 3:	 Define a lambda function res that takes two arguments x and y

Step 4:	 The lambda function compares the numbers and prints which one is smaller: If x > y, it prints num2 is smaller than num1. Otherwise, it prints num1 is smaller than num2.

Step 5:	 Call the res Function: Pass num1 and num2 to the lambda function to perform the comparison.

Step 6:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```num1=eval(input())
num2=eval(input())
max=lambda x,y: print(f"{num2} is smaller than {num1}") if x>y else print(f"{num1} is smaller than {num2}")![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3ccdb3-e831-41b8-b783-4f58c664521e)

max(num1,num2)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program to check a relationship between two numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.


Exp.No:2(d)	LOOPING PATTERNS- PRINTING PATTERN

### AIM
To write a python program to print the triangular star pattern.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Read the integer n from the user using input(). This will determine the number of rows in the pattern.

Step 3:	 Initialize a variable i = 0. This will be used to control the number of spaces before the stars.

Step 4:	 Loop through rows from 0 to n-1 (this will iterate n times to print the required rows).

Step 5:	  For each row, calculate the number of spaces before the stars. 

Step 6:	 The formula for the number of spaces is ((n - rows - 1) * 2) + i. 

Step 7:	 Print the spaces (" ") using the print(" ", end="") statement. 

Step 8:	 Increment i by 1 after each row.

Step 9:	 For each row, print the stars. The number of stars for each row is equal to rows + 1. Print the stars with print("*", end=" ") to separate them with two spaces.

Step 10:	 After printing each row's stars, print a newline to move to the next row using print("").

Step 11:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```n=int(input())
i=0
for rows in range(0,n):
    for cols in range(((n-rows-1)*2)+i):
        print(" ",end="")
    i+=1
    for star in range(rows+1):
        print("*",end="  ")
    print("")
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program to print the triangular start pattern has been implemented and executed successfully.
























Exp.No:2(e)	SEB- COMPUTING POWER

### AIM
To write a python Program to compute the power of the given number using appropriate built -in function .
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Input the base number (base) from the user.

Step 3:	 Input the exponent number (exp) from the user.

Step 4:	 Use the built-in pow() function to compute the  base raised to the power of exp.

Step 5:	 Print the result using the print() function, displaying the power of the given number in a formatted manner.

Step 6:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```base=int(input())
exp=int(input())
res=pow(base,exp)
print(f"Power of the given number is: {res}")
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program to compute the power using builtin function has been implemented and executed successfully.
